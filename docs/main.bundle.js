The CTF is open for all universities in Norway (and everybody else who would like to checkout out the CTF)! Interested in practical security/hacking, but don\'t know where to start? Then this hacking competition is perfect for you! We host a beginner CTF to teach you loads of cool security and programming stuff. The people from UiO-CTF will be present to help everyone who might be stuck. Our competition contain tasks in the categories web security, cryptography, binary exploitation, reverse engineering and forensics. Each category has a couple of tasks with various difficulties.'},{date:'2019-02-13',topic:'Reverse Engineering',description:'In this workshop we continue reverse engineering with IDA.
