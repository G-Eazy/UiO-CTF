The workshops are based on tasks from hacking competitions (CTFs), and show how to exploit vulnerabilities. We regularly participate in CTFs, and meet up to solve tasks together a few times each semester. You are more than welcome to join us while solving hacking tasks!

Interested in practical security/hacking, but don't know where to start? Then this hacking competition is perfect for you! We host a beginner CTF to teach you loads of cool security and programming stuff. The people from UiO-CTF will be present to help everyone who might be stuck. Our competition contain tasks in the categories web security, cryptography, binary exploitation, reverse engineering and forensics. Each category has a couple of tasks with various difficulties."

After the presentation, we will have a mini CTF with the tasks we've gone through in the last two workshops. Now you can practice your reverse engineering skills! Don't worry if you've never done this before or did not attend the other two workshops. We go around, help you and make sure you learn something cool."

This time we are going to cover multiple topics (web hacking, binary exploitation, reverse engineering) with some easy examples. The workshop is for beginners, no previous experience of hacking is needed.  We present a hacking challenge and how to solve it, then the students solve it. UiO-CTF members will be available to help you with the tasks."
